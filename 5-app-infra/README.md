## Purpose

The purpose of this step is to deploy a simple [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) instance in one of the business unit projects using the infra pipeline set up in 4-projects.
The infra pipeline is created in step `4-projects` within the shared env and has a [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs) pipeline configured to manage infrastructure within projects.
To enable deployment via this pipeline, the projects deployed should [enable](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation/blob/master/4-projects/business_unit_1/development/example_base_shared_vpc_project.tf#L31-L32) the `enable_cloudbuild_deploy` flag and provide the Cloud Build service account value via `cloudbuild_sa`.

This enables the Cloud Build service account to impersonate the project service account and use it to deploy infrastructure. The roles required for the project SA can also be [managed](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation/blob/master/4-projects/business_unit_1/development/example_base_shared_vpc_project.tf#L30) via `sa_roles`. (Note: This requires per project SA impersonation. If you would like to have a single SA managing an environment and all associated projects, that is also possible by [granting](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation/blob/master/4-projects/modules/single_project/main.tf#L62-L68) `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` to an SA with the right roles in `4-projects/env`.)

There is also a [Source Repository](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories) configured with build triggers similar to the [CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation#0-bootstrap) setup in `0-bootstrap`.
This Compute Engine instance is created using the base network from step `3-networks` and is used to access private services.

## Prerequisites

1. 0-bootstrap executed successfully.
1. 1-org executed successfully.
1. 2-environments executed successfully.
1. 3-networks executed successfully.
1. 4-projects executed successfully.

### Troubleshooting

Please refer to [troubleshooting](../docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if you run into issues during this step.

## Usage

**Note:** If you are using MacOS, replace `cp -RT` with `cp -R` in the relevant
commands. The `-T` flag is needed for Linux, but causes problems for MacOS.

### Deploying with Cloud Build

1. Get the Infra Pipeline project ID from the previous step. Run the following in the
   `gcp-projects/business_unit_1/shared` folder.
   ```
   terraform output cloudbuild_project_id
   ```
1. Clone the policies repo. **Note:** This repo has the same name as the repo created in step 1-org, to prevent a collision the command below will clone it in folder gcp-policies-app-infra.
   ```
   gcloud source repos clone gcp-policies gcp-policies-app-infra --project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID
   ```
1. Navigate into the repo. All subsequent steps assume you are running them
   from the gcp-policies-app-infra directory. If you run them from another directory,
   adjust your copy paths accordingly.
   ```
   cd gcp-policies-app-infra
   git checkout -b main
   ```
1. Copy contents of policy-library to new repo.
   ```
   cp -RT ../terraform-example-foundation/policy-library/ .
   ```
1. Commit changes.
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Your message'
   ```
1. Push your main branch to the new repo.
   ```
   git push --set-upstream origin main
   ```
1. Navigate out of the repo.
   ```
   cd ..
   ```
1. Clone the `bu1-example-app` repo.
   ```
   gcloud source repos clone bu1-example-app --project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID
   ```
1. Navigate into the repo. All subsequent steps assume you are running them
   from the bu1-example-app directory. If you run them from another directory,
   adjust your copy paths accordingly.
   ```
   cd bu1-example-app
   ```
1. Change freshly cloned repo and change to non-main branch.
   ```
   git checkout -b plan
   ```
1. Copy contents of foundation to new repo.
   ```
   cp -RT ../terraform-example-foundation/5-app-infra/ .
   ```
1. Copy Cloud Build configuration files for Terraform.
   ```
   cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/cloudbuild-tf-* .
   ```
1. Copy the Terraform wrapper script to the root of your new repository.
   ```
   cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/tf-wrapper.sh .
   ```
1. Ensure wrapper script can be executed.
   ```
   chmod 755 ./tf-wrapper.sh
   ```
1. Rename `common.auto.example.tfvars` to `common.auto.tfvars` and update the file with values from your environment and 0-bootstrap. See any of the business unit 1 envs folders [README.md](./business_unit_1/development/README.md) files for additional information on the values in the `common.auto.tfvars` file.
1. Rename `bu1-development.auto.example.tfvars` to `bu1-development.auto.tfvars` and update the file with values from your environment.
1. Rename `bu1-non-production.auto.example.tfvars` to `bu1-non-production.auto.tfvars` and update the file with values from your environment.
1. Rename `bu1-production.auto.example.tfvars` to `bu1-production.auto.tfvars` and update the file with values from your environment.
1. Commit changes.
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Your message'
   ```
1. Push your plan branch to trigger a plan for all environments. Because the
   _plan_ branch is not a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch), pushing your _plan_
   branch triggers _terraform plan_ but not _terraform apply_.
   ```
   git push --set-upstream origin plan
   ```
1. Review the plan output in your Cloud Build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID
1. Merge changes to development. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
   pushing to this branch triggers both _terraform plan_ and _terraform apply_.
   ```
   git checkout -b development
   git push origin development
   ```
1. Review the apply output in your Cloud Build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID
1. Merge changes to non-production. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
   pushing to this branch triggers both _terraform plan_ and _terraform apply_.
   ```
   git checkout -b non-production
   git push origin non-production
   ```
1. Review the apply output in your Cloud Build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID
1. Merge changes to production branch. Because this is a [named environment branch](../docs/FAQ.md#what-is-a-named-branch),
      pushing to this branch triggers both _terraform plan_ and _terraform apply_.
   ```
   git checkout -b production
   git push origin production
   ```
1. Review the apply output in your Cloud Build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=YOUR_INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID

### Run Terraform locally

1. Change into `5-app-infra` folder, copy the Terraform wrapper script and ensure it can be executed.
   ```
   cd 5-app-infra
   cp ../build/tf-wrapper.sh .
   chmod 755 ./tf-wrapper.sh
   ```
1. Rename `auto.example.tfvars` files to `auto.tfvars`.
   ```
   mv common.auto.example.tfvars common.auto.tfvars
   mv bu1-development.auto.example.tfvars bu1-development.auto.tfvars
   mv bu1-non-production.auto.example.tfvars bu1-non-production.auto.tfvars
   mv bu1-production.auto.example.tfvars bu1-production.auto.tfvars
   ```
1. Update `common.auto.tfvars` file with values from your environment.
1. Update files `bu1-development.auto.tfvars`, `bu1-non-production.auto.tfvars`, and `bu1-production.auto.tfvars` with values from 4-projects output.
1. Use `terraform output` to get the project service account values from 4-projects output.
   ```
   export dev_sa=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/business_unit_1/development/" output -raw base_shared_vpc_project_sa)
   export non_prod_sa=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/business_unit_1/non-production/" output -raw base_shared_vpc_project_sa)
   export prod_sa=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/business_unit_1/production/" output -raw base_shared_vpc_project_sa)

   echo "development project_service_account = ${dev_sa}"
   echo "non-production project_service_account = ${non_prod_sa}"
   echo "production project_service_account = ${prod_sa}"
   ```
1. Provide the user that will be running `./tf-wrapper.sh` the Service Account Token Creator role to the bu1 project service accounts
1. Provide the user permissions to run the terraform locally with the `serviceAccountTokenCreator` permission.
   ```
   member="user:$(gcloud auth list --filter="status=ACTIVE" --format="value(account)")"
   echo ${member}

   dev_project=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/business_unit_1/development/" output -raw base_shared_vpc_project)
   non_prod_project=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/business_unit_1/non-production/" output -raw base_shared_vpc_project)
   prod_project=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/business_unit_1/production/" output -raw base_shared_vpc_project)

   gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "${dev_sa}" --project "${dev_project}" --member="${member}" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
   gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "${non_prod_sa}" --project "${non_prod_project}" --member="${member}" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
   gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "${prod_sa}" --project "${prod_project}" --member="${member}" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
   ```
1. Update `backend.tf` with your bucket from the infra pipeline example.
   ```
   export backend_bucket=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/business_unit_1/shared/" output -json state_buckets | jq '.[0]' | tr -d '"')
   echo "backend_bucket = ${backend_bucket}"

   for i in `find -name 'backend.tf'`; do sed -i "s/UPDATE_ME/${backend_bucket}/" $i; done
   ```

We will now deploy each of our environments (development/production/non-production) using this script.
When using Cloud Build or Jenkins as your CI/CD tool, each environment corresponds to a branch in the repository for the `5-app-infra` step. Only the corresponding environment is applied.

To use the `validate` option of the `tf-wrapper.sh` script, please follow the [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation/validate-policies#install) to install the terraform-tools component.

1. Use `terraform output` to get the Infra Pipeline Project ID from 4-projects output.
   ```
   export INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID=$(terraform -chdir="../4-projects/business_unit_1/shared/" output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```
1. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment production.
   ```
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init production
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan production
   ```
1. Run `validate` and check for violations.
   ```
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate production $(pwd)/../policy-library ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```
1. Run `apply` production.
   ```
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply production
   ```
1. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment non-production.
   ```
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init non-production
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan non-production
   ```
1. Run `validate` and check for violations.
   ```
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate non-production $(pwd)/../policy-library ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```
1. Run `apply` non-production.
   ```
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply non-production
   ```
1. Run `init` and `plan` and review output for environment development.
   ```
   ./tf-wrapper.sh init development
   ./tf-wrapper.sh plan development
   ```
1. Run `validate` and check for violations.
   ```
   ./tf-wrapper.sh validate development $(pwd)/../policy-library ${INFRA_PIPELINE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```
1. Run `apply` development.
   ```
   ./tf-wrapper.sh apply development
   ```

If you received any errors or made any changes to the Terraform config or `terraform.tfvars` you must re-run `./tf-wrapper.sh plan <env>` before running `./tf-wrapper.sh apply <env>`.
